Cereal Rating using Multiple Linear Regression

Based on various factors like calories, protein, fat, fiber, sugars, potassium, vitamins, etc.
A rating score is given for the cereals.

And the built model uses multiple linear regression to predict the rating

Step 1: Understanding the data and the various columns 
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
        Step 2a: Finding the correlation of input(independent) and output(dependent) variables.
        Step 2b: Eliminating the columns that have lower correlation
Step 3: Preparing the training and test data using train_test_split
Step 4: Building the model using Linear Regression and finding accuracy
Step 5: Applying L2 regularization and finding accuracy
